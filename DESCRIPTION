Description: Phylogenetic comparative methods represent models of continuous trait 
  data associated with the tips of a phylogenetic tree. Examples of such models 
  are Gaussian continuous time branching stochastic processes such as Brownian 
  motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, which regard the data at the 
  tips of the tree as an observed (final) state of a Markov process starting from 
  an initial state at the root and evolving along the branches of the tree. 
  PCMBayes provides reversible jump MCMC samplers for mixed Gaussian phylogenetic
  models.
